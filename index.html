    <h1>WORK OUT BRUHSKIII</h1>
    <p>
      Include the JavaScript file provided in your project,
      <br />
      loading your project, ask the user "Enter a city" (example: Paris),
      <br />
      alert "It is currently 19°C (66°F) in Paris with a humidity of 80%"
      <br />
      If the city doesn't exist in the object (i.e: Sydney), alert "Sorry, we
      don't know the weather for this city, try going to
      https://www.google.com/search?q=weather+sydney".
      <br />
      Since this is an alert, the link shouldn't be clickable.
      <br />
      Add this behavior to your project and submit the CodeSandbox URL
      <br />
      Note: Please round the values in the Alert to the nearest whole number (no
      decimal points, e.g. 5.45 should be rounded to 5).
